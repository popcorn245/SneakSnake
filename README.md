# SneakSnake

SneakSnake is an open source multiplayer snake game.

## What'sss Thissss?

I have always been fascinated with game development, but never made the time to actually make a game.  I really like the simplicty of some of the old cell phone games & gameboy games of the past and love when something like Tetris 99 brings that concept back with a new twist.  This project aims to bring snake back from the dead with some new fun mechanics.

## What About SSsslither?!?

Slither.io was one of the former sites that did this and spawned tons of clones, but the mechanics all rely on just slapping as many people into a lobby and letting them duke it out, where as I want to add more complexity to the game and the ability to spin up your own lobby to play with friends.

## What Mechanicsss?

I think it would be cool to add mechanics to allow the snakes to battle eachother and rather than just trying to get people to run into eachother, you work to get the longer snake and try to get different power-ups to shorten other people's snakes or lengthen yours.  The matches could be a set of timed rouds or last man standing.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
