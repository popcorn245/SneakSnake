## What'sss Thissss?

SneakSnake is an open source multiplayer snake game.  I have always been fascinated with game development, but never made the time to actually make a game.  I really like the simplicty of some of the old cell phone games & gameboy games of the past and love when something like Tetris 99 brings that concept back with a new twist.  This project aims to bring snake back from the dead with some new fun mechanics.

## What About SSsslither?!?

Slither.io was one of the former sites that did this and spawned tons of clones, but the mechanics all rely on just slapping as many people into a lobby and letting them duke it out, where as I want to add more complexity to the game and the ability to spin up your own lobby to play with friends.

## What Mechanicsss?

I think it would be cool to add mechanics to allow the snakes to battle eachother and rather than just trying to get people to run into eachother, you work to get the longer snake and try to get different power-ups to shorten other people's snakes or lengthen yours.  The matches could be a set of timed rouds or last man standing.
